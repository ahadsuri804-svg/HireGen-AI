## HireGen-AI

HireGen-AI is an AI-powered interview and hiring assistant designed to automate and improve the recruitment process. The system analyzes a candidate’s resume, conducts an intelligent interview, and generates a detailed evaluation report to help recruiters make better decisions.

This project is developed as a **Final Year Project (FYP)** and focuses on combining modern web technologies with AI models to simulate a real interview experience.

## What the project does

HireGen-AI works in the following flow:

1. **Resume Upload**
   The candidate uploads their resume through a React-based web interface.

2. **Resume Parsing**
   The backend extracts key information such as skills, experience, and education from the resume.

3. **AI-Driven Interview**
   Based on the parsed resume, the AI dynamically generates interview questions and conducts the interview using text and voice interaction.

4. **Candidate Evaluation**
   The system analyzes responses and performance during the interview.

5. **Report Generation**
   A structured interview report is generated, summarizing strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability. The report can be downloaded by the user.
